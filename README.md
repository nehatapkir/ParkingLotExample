# ParkingLotExample

C# Project to design a Parking lot that caters to multiple location types viz. Mall, Airport and Stadium. The project involves 2 simple steps - park and unpark.

Following assumptions were made during the design:
- Each vehicle type can be parked only in the space type allocated to it (e.g. Car/SUV can only be parked in the Car Parking space and not in the Truck parking space)
- In the real world date time in and out should not be a manual input. The datetimes have been added to the park and unpark methods to allow ease of testing in the absence of a database.

Refer to the ParkingLotTests unit tests project to follow the flow of the code.
